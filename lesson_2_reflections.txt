What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	The directory '.git' is created and the needed files are initialized.
	I'll need those files and directories for version control.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is the zone where we store all the file we are changing now. Those changes aren't completed yet and thus is not possible to bring them to the repository.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By grouping in the staged area all the files logically related before commit the changes.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When we are programming new functionalities, new versions with other features but the same base etc. 
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	The diagrams say to us where, in which point, the branch is born, what is the history of its develop and what is their relation with the main branch and other branches.
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	It results in that one of them disappears into the actual 'Head' and only one branch remains with the name of current 'Head' branch.
